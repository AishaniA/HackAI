# HackAI
pip install pdfplumber

current plans:
- use pdfplumber to parse through tables and text
-  use pymu and pytesseract to parse through images
-  set up a database using firestream/firebase to store chunks of data
-  implement RAG
-  create a friendly to use website which can easily allow users to read pdfs
-  use an AI API (openai?) to generate text answers based on the database
